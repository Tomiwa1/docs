# DesignByExamples

**DesignByExamples** is an open-source documentation that explains core product design concepts through **clear definitions, practical guidance, and real examples across modern design tools**.

This project is built on a simple idea:

> Design tools change.  
> Design concepts don’t.

---

## Why DesignByExamples exists

Most design documentation today is:

- Tool-specific
- Feature-driven
- Hard to translate across platforms

As a result, designers often learn _how to use tools_ without fully understanding:

- **What problem a concept solves**
- **When it should be used**
- **How it applies across different tools**

DesignByExamples flips that approach.

We start with the **concept**, then show how that same concept is implemented in tools like **Figma, Framer, Lovable, and V0**.

---

## What you’ll find here

Every concept in DesignByExamples follows a consistent structure:

- **What the concept is**  
  A clear, plain-language explanation.

- **When to use it**  
  Practical scenarios and decision guidance.

- **Core principles**  
  The rules that make the concept work.

- **How it works across tools**  
  Side-by-side explanations of how different tools implement the same idea.

- **Common mistakes**  
  Patterns that lead to fragile or inconsistent designs.

The goal is not mastery of a single tool —  
the goal is **transferable design thinking**.

---

## Who this is for

DesignByExamples is for:

- Product designers building real-world interfaces
- Designers transitioning into design systems or design engineering
- Engineers who want to better understand design intent
- Anyone working across multiple design tools

If you’ve ever thought:

> “I know how this works in one tool, but I don’t really understand the concept behind it”

You’re in the right place.

---

## Open source & community-driven

DesignByExamples is an open-source project.

That means:

- Anyone can contribute
- Concepts evolve as tools evolve
- The documentation reflects real-world usage, not marketing narratives

If you care about clarity, systems thinking, and better design collaboration — contributions are welcome.

## A note on tools

Tools are important.  
But tools are not the point.

DesignByExamples treats tools as **implementations of ideas**, not the ideas themselves.

Once you understand the concept, switching tools becomes much easier.

**Let’s build better systems, one concept at a time.**
