Components are rarely used in a single context. The same component may appear in dense tables, spacious dashboards, modal dialogs, or mobile views. Scaling a component across these contexts requires deliberate control of density, not redesign.

A component should retain its identity while adapting its spatial and visual weight to its environment. This allows users to recognize functionality consistently, even as layout constraints change.

### Context Determines Density

The appropriate density of a component is determined by its surrounding layout and the user’s task, not by the component itself.

For example:
- In information-dense views, components must compress without losing clarity
- In focus-driven views, the same components may expand to support attention and interaction

This adaptability should be planned, not improvised.

---

### Variable Density States

Well-designed components support multiple density states rather than a single fixed configuration.

Common variations include:
- Compact: reduced padding and simplified content for high-density layouts
- Default: balanced spacing for general use
- Spacious: increased padding and emphasis for focused interactions

These variations should be systematic, using predictable adjustments to padding, spacing, and internal hierarchy rather than ad hoc overrides.

### Preserving Hierarchy Across Scales

As components scale, hierarchy must remain intact.

Scaling should not flatten importance or introduce unintended emphasis. Primary actions should remain primary, and secondary information should not gain weight simply because space is available.

This requires:
- Proportional scaling of padding and spacing
- Consistent typographic hierarchy
- Controlled use of contrast across contexts

The goal is visual continuity, not visual sameness.

---

### Component Systems, Not Instances

Designing components for scale means thinking in terms of systems rather than isolated instances.

Components should expose:
- Clear rules for padding and spacing
- Defined density variants
- Constraints on how content expands or contracts

This enables components to be reused confidently across products, screens, and devices without constant redesign or manual adjustment.

---

### Design Implications

Scaling components effectively reduces design debt.

When density, hierarchy, and scaling behavior are defined at the component level:
- Screens compose faster
- Inconsistencies decrease
- Design decisions become predictable

Components that scale well allow the system to grow without sacrificing clarity or usability.
