### Components as Visual Containers

In interface design, components function as visual containers for information and interaction.

A component is not defined solely by its role in a design system (e.g. button, card, list item), but by how users perceive it as a bounded unit. Each component establishes a local context that groups content, signals hierarchy, and constrains attention.

For this reason, components are the primary level at which density is experienced.

### Components Define Local Density

While density can be discussed at the page level, it is most effectively controlled at the component level. Each component determines how much information is presented together and how tightly related elements are grouped.

Two screens may follow the same grid and spacing rules, yet feel very different if individual components differ in:
- Internal spacing
- Text scale and weight
- Number of interactive elements
- Visual separation from surrounding content

Density inconsistencies typically originate inside components rather than across the overall layout.

### Containment and Grouping

Visual containment communicates relationship.

When elements are placed within a shared container, users interpret them as belonging together and being part of a single task or concept. Conversely, insufficient containment can cause related elements to appear disconnected, while excessive containment can make unrelated elements feel artificially grouped.

Effective containers balance:
- Clear boundaries
- Internal hierarchy
- Appropriate spacing between elements

This balance allows users to parse components as single units without needing to evaluate each element independently.

### Component Weight and Hierarchy

Every component carries visual weight based on its size, padding, contrast, and internal structure. This weight affects how prominently the component competes for attention relative to others on the screen.

Problems arise when multiple components are assigned similar visual weight despite differing importance. In such cases, the interface appears flat, and users struggle to identify primary actions or focal areas.

Adjusting component weight is often more effective than changing color or typography. Reducing internal density, simplifying content, or increasing separation can de-emphasise a component without removing functionality.

### Reuse and Context Sensitivity

Components are typically designed for reuse across multiple contexts. However, density requirements often change depending on where and how a component is used.

A component that feels appropriate in isolation may become visually heavy when repeated in a list or combined with other dense components. Conversely, a component designed for a dense environment may feel sparse or under-informative when used alone.

For this reason, component design should allow for controlled variation in:
- Padding
- Text hierarchy
- Visible metadata
- Interaction affordances

Reuse should preserve structural consistency while allowing density to adapt to context.

### Practical Implication

Treat components as the primary unit for managing density and hierarchy. Layout systems determine placement, but components determine how much cognitive effort is required within each region of the interface.

When an interface feels cluttered or unfocused, examining component structure and internal density is often more effective than adjusting global spacing or layout rules.
