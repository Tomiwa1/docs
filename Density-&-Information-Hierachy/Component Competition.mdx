## When Components Compete for Attention

Component competition occurs when multiple components demand a similar level of visual attention despite differing functional importance.

In well-calibrated interfaces, attention is distributed intentionally. Primary components guide user focus, while secondary components remain discoverable without interrupting task flow. When this balance breaks down, users experience hesitation, scanning friction, or decision paralysis.

### Sources of Component Competition

Competition typically arises from similarities in visual treatment rather than explicit design errors. Components may compete when they share comparable:

- Visual weight (size, padding, contrast)
- Text hierarchy (headline scale and emphasis)
- Interaction affordances (multiple primary actions)
- Structural prominence within the layout

Even when components serve different purposes, uniform emphasis can cause them to appear equally important.

### Internal vs Cross-Component Competition

Competition can occur both within a single component and across multiple components on a screen.

Within a component, competition appears when:
- Secondary information visually rivals primary content
- Supporting actions appear as prominent as core actions
- Metadata interrupts the reading or interaction flow

Across components, competition appears when:
- Multiple components adopt “primary” visual treatment
- Repeated components accumulate excessive weight
- No clear focal region emerges within the interface

In both cases, the result is reduced clarity rather than overt visual disorder.

### Effects on User Behaviour

When components compete for attention, users must actively resolve hierarchy on their own. This increases cognitive effort and slows interaction.

Common behavioural signals include:
- Extended scanning before taking action
- Missed primary actions
- Unintended interactions with secondary controls
- Repeated checking or backtracking

These effects often appear even when individual components are well-designed in isolation.

### Resolving Competition Through De-Emphasis

Competition is rarely resolved by adding stronger emphasis elsewhere. Instead, it is reduced by selectively removing emphasis where it is not required.

Effective de-emphasis techniques include:
- Reducing internal density
- Lowering contrast or visual weight
- Simplifying secondary content
- Increasing separation between components

These adjustments allow primary components to emerge naturally without introducing additional visual noise.

### Diagnostic Use in Design Review

Component competition is a useful diagnostic lens during design critique and usability testing.

If users struggle to identify what to do next, or describe a screen as confusing despite clear layout structure, component competition should be examined before introducing new hierarchy rules or visual treatments.

Addressing competition at the component level preserves system consistency while restoring clarity.
