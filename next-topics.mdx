1. Foundations: Visual Grammar
1.1 Typography Systems

Hierarchy & information priority

Type scales and sizing logic

Line height, paragraph width, rhythm

Optical vs mathematical sizing

Typeface choice (UX impact, not taste)

1.2 Color Systems

Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 / 3.0 context)

Semantic colors (success, warning, error)

Contrast and emphasis

RGB vs HSL (practical usage)

1.3 Layout Systems

Auto-Layout / Stacks

Grids (CSS Grid for designers)

Constraints & resizing logic

8pt grid as a spacing philosophy

1.4 Spacing Systems (important addition)

Spacing scales

Vertical rhythm

Perceived vs actual spacing

When consistency should break

1.5 Iconography & Visual Assets

Stroke weights

Bounding boxes

Optical alignment

SVG optimization basics



1.1.4 Line Height, Measure & Vertical Rhythm

This is about readability mechanics.

Covers:

Line height vs font size (why 120% isn’t universal)

Paragraph width (optimal character count)

Line length vs reading speed

Vertical rhythm and baseline alignment

Why bad rhythm feels “off” even when sizes are right

This is foundational but often undocumented.

1.1.5 Optical vs Mathematical Sizing

Advanced, but extremely important.

Covers:

Why two fonts at the same px size don’t look the same

Cap height, x-height, ascenders, descenders

Optical corrections designers make subconsciously

Why icons and text rarely align mathematically

Practical rules for visual alignment

This separates juniors from seniors.

1.1.6 Typeface Choice (UX Impact, Not Taste)

This should be explicitly anti-aesthetic in tone.

Covers:

Serif vs sans-serif in digital interfaces

Readability vs personality

UI fonts vs display fonts

Variable fonts and performance

Cultural & accessibility considerations

When branding conflicts with usability

Frame this as constraints-based selection, not preference.

1.1.7 Responsive Typography

Optional but powerful if included.

Covers:

Breakpoint-based typography

Fluid typography (clamp())

When headings scale but body text shouldn’t

Touch, distance, and context-aware sizing

This bridges typography → layout → code.

1.1.8 Common Typography Anti-Patterns

End the section with this.

Covers:

Too many font sizes

Fake hierarchy using weight only

Poor contrast masked by “nice fonts”

Over-tight or over-loose line height

Designing typography in isolation from layout

This reinforces learning through failure.
