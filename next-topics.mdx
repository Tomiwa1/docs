Now let’s redesign the sections properly

1. Layout

Things about positioning, flow, and structure.

Examples of pages:

Auto layout / stacks

Grids

Alignment & distribution

Padding & margin

Fixed vs fluid layouts

2. Components

Things about reuse.

Examples:

Creating reusable components

Variants

States (hover, active, disabled)

Nesting components

Updating components safely

3. Responsiveness

Things about adapting to screens/content.

Examples:

Responsive cards

Breakpoints

Content-driven resizing

Adaptive vs fluid layouts

4. Styling

Visual consistency, but still practical.

Examples:

Managing colors consistently

Text styles

Icon sizing

Border radius systems

(Notice: no “color theory” — just how to do it.)

5. Design Systems

Only when needed.

Examples:

Design tokens

Variables

Naming conventions

Scaling a system
