## Optical vs Mathematical Sizing

Typography often looks *wrong* even when the numbers are correct.

Two text elements can share the same font family, weight, and pixel size — yet one appears larger, heavier, or more dominant than the other. This isn’t a bug in your design system. It’s a consequence of **optical perception**.

To understand why, we need to separate two ideas:

- **Mathematical sizing** — what the numbers say  
- **Optical sizing** — what the eye perceives  

### Mathematical Sizing

Mathematical sizing treats typography as a system of exact values.

If two text elements are both set to:

- Font size: `16px`
- Font weight: `400`
- Line height: `1.5`

They are considered equal.

Design tools, CSS, and design systems rely on this assumption. It is necessary for consistency, predictability, and implementation.

But mathematical consistency does **not** guarantee visual consistency.

### Optical Sizing

Optical sizing acknowledges that humans do not perceive text numerically.

The eye responds to:
- Stroke thickness
- Letter width
- x-height
- Counter shapes
- Vertical proportions

Because of this, two fonts set to the same pixel size can appear visually different, even when they are technically identical in value.

For example:
- A font with a **large x-height** appears bigger at the same size
- A condensed font appears smaller than a wide one
- A heavy stroke weight makes text feel larger and denser
- Round shapes often appear larger than square ones

The numbers stay the same. The perception does not.

### Why Equal Sizes Look Unequal

Consider this common scenario:

You place a heading and a button label side by side.

Both are set to:
- `16px`
- Same font family
- Same weight

Yet the button label feels heavier or more dominant.

This usually happens because:
- The button text is uppercase
- Uppercase letters have uniform height and thicker visual mass
- The surrounding padding amplifies its presence

Numerically, nothing is wrong. Optically, the balance is off.

### Font Size Is Not Visual Size

Font size defines the height of the font’s **em box**, not the visible height of letters.

Within that box:
- Ascenders, descenders, and x-height vary by typeface
- Different fonts occupy different proportions of the same box
- The visible glyphs rarely fill the full height

This is why:
- Two `16px` fonts can feel like `15px` and `17px`
- Switching fonts without adjusting sizes often breaks hierarchy
- “Same size” does not mean “same presence”

### Optical Adjustments in Practice

Good typography often involves breaking mathematical consistency slightly to achieve visual consistency.

Common optical adjustments include:
- Reducing uppercase text size by 1–2px
- Slightly increasing line height for dense fonts
- Decreasing font weight for large headings
- Adjusting letter spacing based on size, not rules

These changes are intentional. They are not hacks.

They compensate for how the eye interprets form.

## Optical Sizing Exercise
This exercise demonstrates why text with the same numeric size can appear visually unequal, and how optical sizing corrects that imbalance.

You do not need plugins or special tools.  
Only your eyes.
<img

style={{ height: "auto", width: "auto" }}
className="rounded-lg"

<Steps>
  <Step title="Establish a Baseline">
   Create a text layer and type "bubble', duplicate the text layer and change the text to 'minimum'
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the following properties:">
    - Font size: `16px`
    - Font weight: `400 (Regular)`
    - Line height: `Auto`
    - Letter spacing: `0`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Zoom the canvas to 100%">
    Although both words use identical values, they do not feel equally weighted. 
    `bubble` appears heavier due to its round shapes and thicker visual mass.  
    `minimum` appears lighter because it is composed of narrow vertical strokes and more negative space.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Apply Optical Sizing">
    Adjust the text to correct perception rather than numbers:

    - Reduce `bubble` from `16px` to `15px`
    - Increase `minimum` from `16px` to `17px`

The words now feel closer in visual weight even though their font sizes are no longer equal.

  </Step>
</Steps>
This is optical sizing in practice.

### Design Systems vs Visual Reality

Design systems prefer numbers because numbers scale.

But typography lives in perception.

This is why many mature systems:
- Define **optical size ranges** instead of fixed values
- Adjust type tokens per font family
- Treat labels, headings, and body text differently even at the same size

Consistency in typography is not about sameness.

It is about **visual balance across contexts**.

### Key Takeaway

While mathematical sizing provides order, optical sizing ensures clarity. Typography succeeds when it looks right, regardless of whether the numbers align.
