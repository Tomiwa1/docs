Font size alone does not determine readability.

How text *breathes* vertically and horizontally, has as much impact on comprehension as the typeface itself. 

Line height, paragraph width, and vertical rhythm determine:
- how easily text can be scanned
- how long users can read without fatigue
- whether text-heavy interfaces feel structured or cluttered

These properties are often adjusted visually without a clear rationale, which leads to inconsistent results across screens and layouts. This section explains how they work, how they relate to each other, and how to apply them deliberately.

#### Line Height

Line height defines the vertical distance between consecutive lines of text.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent visual overlap between lines
- make it easier for the eye to move from the end of one line to the beginning of the next
- maintain readability as text size and line length change

Line height shouldn't just be a fixed number. The right balance depends on your font choice, text size, and where the text is being read.

## Why One Line-Height Ratio Does Not Work Everywhere

Line height cannot be chosen in isolation. It depends on:

- the font’s x-height and proportions  
- how long each line of text is  
- how much text appears in a single block  

For example:

- Fonts with large x-heights often need less line height.  
- Narrow text columns can tolerate tighter spacing.  
- Wide paragraphs require more vertical space so the eye can find the next line.  

Using the same line-height ratio everywhere usually produces text that feels cramped in some contexts and overly loose in others.

## Paragraph Width (Measure)

Paragraph width, also called **measure**, describes how long each line of text is.

Rather than pixels, measure is best understood in **characters per line**.

A commonly effective range for body text is:

- **45–75 characters per line**

Examples:

- A sidebar or card may contain ~40–50 characters per line.  
- A full-width desktop layout may exceed 100 characters per line if unconstrained.  

Even if font size and line height remain unchanged, very long lines are harder to read.  
This is why long-form text is usually placed inside containers with a `max-width`.

## Line Length and Line Height Work Together

Line length and line height must be adjusted together.

- **Short lines** (cards, narrow columns)  
  → slightly tighter line height often works well.

- **Long lines** (wide layouts, documentation pages)  
  → line height usually needs to increase to maintain readability.

Using tight line height with long lines is a common cause of dense, tiring text.
