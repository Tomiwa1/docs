### 1.1.2 Hierarchy & Information Priority

Hierarchy is how an interface communicates **what matters most**.

Before color, before layout polish, before visual flair, hierarchy answers one core question:

> *What should the user notice first, second, and last?*

Typography is the primary tool used to encode that decision.

#### Levels of Information

Most interfaces contain three broad levels of information:

- **Primary information**  
  The main message or action. If users only read one thing, it should be this.

- **Secondary information**  
  Supporting context that helps users understand or act on the primary message.

- **Tertiary information**  
  Optional, background, or reference content that should not compete for attention.

A hierarchy system ensures these levels are visually distinct **without explanation**.

If users have to read carefully to understand importance, hierarchy has failed.

#### Text Roles in Interfaces

Typography systems typically map information levels to clear text roles:

- **Headlines**  
  Communicate intent and structure. They anchor attention and scanning.

- **Subheads**  
  Break content into logical sections and guide reading flow.

- **Body text**  
  Carries the core information. Optimized for readability, not emphasis.

- **Meta text**  
  Timestamps, labels, helper text, captions. Always lower priority.

These roles should feel predictable across the product. When everything looks like a headline, nothing is.

#### Visual Weight (How Hierarchy Is Expressed)

Hierarchy is not created by font size alone.

Visual weight is a combination of:

- **Size:** Larger elements attract attention first  
- **Contrast:** Color, weight, and opacity signal importance  
- **Spacing:** More space implies higher priority  
- **Position:** Top, left, and isolated elements are noticed earlier  

Good hierarchy uses multiple signals together. Weak hierarchy relies on one.

---

#### Vertical vs Horizontal Hierarchy

Not all hierarchy flows top to bottom.

- **Vertical hierarchy**  
  Common in reading-heavy interfaces (articles, forms, dashboards). Users scan downward.

- **Horizontal hierarchy**  
  Common in toolbars, tables, and dense UIs. Importance is communicated across a row.

Choosing the wrong hierarchy direction often causes scanning friction, even when typography looks “correct.”

---

#### Common Hierarchy Failures

These patterns usually indicate missing or broken hierarchy:

- Everything uses the same font size and weight  
- Headlines and body text visually compete  
- Secondary content is louder than primary actions  
- Excessive emphasis (too many bold or large elements)  

When hierarchy fails, designers often compensate with color or decoration — which usually makes the problem worse.

---

#### Hierarchy Is a Design Decision

Hierarchy is not about making things look nice.

It is about:
- Reducing cognitive load  
- Guiding attention intentionally  
- Making interfaces scannable under pressure  

Typography systems exist to **lock these decisions into rules**, so they don’t have to be re-made on every screen.

Next, we’ll look at how hierarchy is enforced using **type scales and sizing logic**.
