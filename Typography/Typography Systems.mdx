Typography is one of the most powerful tools in interface design. It determines what users notice first, what they read next, and what they ignore entirely. Yet many interfaces treat typography as a collection of isolated text styles rather than a coherent system.

This section reframes typography as **infrastructure**, not decoration.

A **typography system** is a structured set of rules that governs how text behaves across an interface. It defines relationships between text styles, not just their individual appearance.

In contrast, random text styles emerge when designers:

- Pick font sizes by feel  
- Add new styles whenever something “doesn’t look right”  
- Rely on visual preference instead of logic  

These approaches may work for a single screen, but they break down as soon as a product grows.

A typography system answers questions *before* design decisions are made:

- What information deserves the most attention?
- How does text scale across devices?
- How do different text elements relate to each other?

#### Typography as Information Flow

Typography is fundamentally about **information priority**, not aesthetics.

Every interface contains signals:

- What is primary vs secondary?
- What requires action vs passive reading?
- What can be skimmed vs what must be read carefully?

Font size, weight, spacing, and contrast are not stylistic choices — they are tools for directing attention. A well-designed typography system allows users to understand structure *without thinking*.

If users have to pause to figure out what matters, the typography has failed.

#### Relationship to Layout & Hierarchy

Typography does not exist in isolation.

It works in tandem with:

- **Layout:** grids, spacing, and alignment define how text blocks relate spatially  
- **Hierarchy:** typography reinforces structural importance created by layout  
- **Spacing:** line height and margins affect readability as much as font choice  

Good typography feels obvious because it aligns with layout logic. Bad typography often feels noisy or confusing even when the layout is technically correct.

#### Designing for Scale

Typography systems are designed for **change**.

They must survive:

- New screens and breakpoints  
- Additional features and content types  
- Localization and longer text strings  
- Design system handoff to developers  

This is why typography systems rely on rules, ratios, and constraints rather than one-off decisions. When done correctly, designers don’t redesign typography for every screen, they *apply* the system.

In the sections that follow, we’ll break typography down into its core components: hierarchy, scales, rhythm, optical sizing, and typeface selection — all through the lens of system design, not personal taste.
