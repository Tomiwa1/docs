## How to Create a Pull Request (PR) for Open-Source Projects

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Click the “Fork” button on the project’s GitHub page to create your own copy under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork Locally**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git
   cd PROJECT_NAME
   ```

3. **Add the Original Repo as Upstream**  
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/PROJECT_NAME.git
   ```

4. **Create a New Branch for Your Changes**  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-branch-name
   ```

5. **Make Your Changes**  
   Edit code, add tests, update docs—whatever the issue or feature requires.

6. **Commit with a Clear Message**  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user authentication via OAuth2"
   ```

7. **Push to Your Fork**  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-descriptive-branch-name
   ```

8. **Open the Pull Request**  
   - Go to your fork on GitHub.  
   - Click “Compare & pull request”.  
   - Fill in the template: describe what you changed and why, reference any open issues (e.g., “Closes #123”).  
   - Ensure CI checks pass; address review feedback promptly.

9. **Celebrate & Iterate**  
    Once maintainers merge your PR, your contribution becomes part of the project—congrats!
